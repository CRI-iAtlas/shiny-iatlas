The iAtlas portal serves as an interactive tool for exploring and analyzing immuno-oncology data.

## About the CRI iAtlas

The **Cancer Research Institute (CRI) iAtlas** is an interactive web platform and set of analytic tools for studying interactions between tumors and the immune microenvironment (Eddy et al., F1000Research 2020).  These tools allow researchers to explore associations between a variety of characterizations of immune response and genomic and clinical phenotypes.  The initial version of CRI iAtlas was based on an analysis performed by **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network** on the TCGA data set comprising over 10,000 tumor samples and 33 tumor types (Thorsson et al., Immunity 2018). In this analysis, each tumor sample was scored for a variety of readouts for immune response, such as immune cell composition, adaptive cell receptor repertoire, neoantigen load, and expression of genes coding for immunomodulatory proteins. iAtlas allows researchers to explore these data readouts, and the relation between them in TCGA tumor types and in overarching immune subtypes identified in the study. iAtlas is being expanded to share immune characterizations from other cancer genomics consortia and now includes data on response to immunotherapy agents. CRI iAtlas is made possible through a collaboration between the **Cancer Research Institute**, **Sage Bionetworks**, the **Institute for Systems Biology**, and the **UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center**. CRI iAtlas can be found at https://www.cri-iatlas.org.

### CRI iAtlas Explorer

The main feature of the iAtlas web tool is the **iAtlas Explorer**, which provides several *Analysis Modules* to explore and visualize results from the Immune Lanscape of Cancer. Each module presents information organized by theme, with multiple views and interactive controls to enhance and extend the information included in the original paper figures.

+ **Sample Group Overview:** This module provides short summaries of your selected groups, and allows you to see how they overlap with other groups.
+ **Tumor Microenvironment:** Explore the immune cell proportions in your sample groups.
+ **Immune Feature Trends:** This module allows you to see how immune readouts vary across your groups, and how they relate to one another.
+ **Clinical Outcomes:** Plot survival curves based on immune characteristics and identify variables associated with outcome.
+ **Immunomodulators:** Explore the expression of genes that code for immunomodulating proteins, including checkpoint proteins.
+ **IO Targets:** Explore the expression of genes that code for immuno-oncological (IO) targets.
+ **TIL Maps:** Explore the characteristics of maps of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from analysis of H&E images.
+ **Driver Associations:** Explore asociations of microenvironment with driver mutations.
+ **Copy Number Variation:** Explore associations of microenvironment with gene copy number variations.
+ **Extracellular Networks:** Explore the extracellular networks modulating tumoral immune response.
+ **Cell-Interaction Diagram:** Explore cell and protein abundance on an illustration.
+ **Molecular Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy:** These modules allow you to explore the relationship between possible biomarkers of immune response and the outcome of response to ICI, based on publicly available datasets that we have processed for use in iAtlas: 
  + *ICI Datasets Overview:* Explore categories and groups of the available datasets.
  + *ICI Immune Features:* See how immune readouts vary across your groups and ICI datasets.
  + *ICI Clinical Outcomes:* Plot survival curves based on immune characteristics and identify variables associated with outcome.
  + *ICI Hazard Ratio:* Create Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Models and visualize Hazard Ratio in a heatmap and a forest plot.
  + *ICI Immunomodulators:* Explore the expression of genes that code for immunomodulating proteins, including checkpoint proteins.

## About Sage Bionetworks

Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit biomedical research and technology development organization that was founded in Seattle in 2009. Our focus is to develop and apply open practices to data-intensive research for the advancement of human health. Data-intensive research has become an important component of biomedicine, but it’s not always easy to understand how to apply computational approaches appropriately or how to interpret their results. Sage believes open practices can help. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers work together to provide researchers access to technology tools and scientific approaches to share data, benchmark methods, and explore collective insights, all backed by Sage’s gold-standard governance protocols and commitment to user-centered design. Sage is a 501c3 and is supported through a portfolio of competitive research grants, commercial partnerships, and philanthropic contributions. More information is available at www.sagebionetworks.org.

## About Institute for Systems Biology

ISB was created in 2000 as the first-ever institute dedicated to systems biology.  ISB is a collaborative and cross-disciplinary nonprofit biomedical research organization based in Seattle. ISB focuses on some of the most pressing issues in human health, including brain health, cancer, sepsis and aging, as well as many chronic and infectious diseases. ISB is an affiliate of Providence St. Joseph Health, one of the largest not-for-profit health care systems in the USA. ISB serves as the ultimate environment where scientific collaboration stretches across disciplines and across academic and industrial organizations, where researchers have the intellectual freedom to challenge the status quo, and where grand visions for breakthroughs in human health inspire a collective drive to achieve the seemingly impossible.

### TCGA PanCancer Atlas Immune Response Working Group

The TCGA Immune Response Working Group (IRWG) comprised a diverse set of researchers devoted to exploring the relationship between tumors and the immune microenvironment and its impact on patient outcomes.  This working group was one of many in the TCGA PanCancer Atlas initiative, each exploring a different aspect of cross-tumor type analysis. Each reported their findings in a  series of articles in Cell Press in April 2018 https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/pancanceratlas/pancani3/index.html.

Highlights of the study conducted by the IRWG (Thorsson et al., Immunity, 2018) include the following:

+ six identified immune subtypes span cancer tissue types and molecular subtypes;
+ immune subtypes differ by somatic aberrations, microenvironment and survival;
+ multiple control modalities of molecular networks affect tumor-immune interactions.
