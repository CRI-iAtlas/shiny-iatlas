# Shiny-iAtlas

Shiny-iAtlas is an interactive web portal that provides multiple analysis modules to visualize and explore immune response characterizations across cancer types. The app is hosted on shinyapps.io at [https://isb-cgc.shinyapps.io/shiny-iatlas/](https://isb-cgc.shinyapps.io/shiny-iatlas/) and can also be accessed via the main CRI iAtlas page at [http://www.cri-iatlas.org/](http://www.cri-iatlas.org/).

The portal is built entirely in **R** and **Shiny** using the **RStudio** development environment. Layout and interactivity within the portal are achieved by heavy use of the following packages:

- [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/)
- [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/)

## Install

### Install Core Apps and System libraries

- R: [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) - v3.6.2

- RStudio: [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

- lib cairo: [https://www.cairographics.org/](https://www.cairographics.org/)

- Docker: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Initialize R Packages, Database and run App

To run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository

1. Open `shiny-iatlas.Rproj`

1. Install packages. In the RStudio console, run:

   ```R
   renv::restore()
   ```

   This may take some time to complete - get something nice to drink :)

1. Build the database locally with the following:

   1. Make the database function available by executing the following in the R console:

      ```R
      source("iatlas_db.R")
      ```

   1. Build the database by executing the following in the R console:

      ```R
      build_iatlas_db(reset = "reset")
      ```

1. Start the app by running:

   ```R
   shiny::runApp()
   ```

## Development

When adding any new dependencies to the application, they may be added using (where "useful_package" is the name of the package to add):

```R
renv::install("useful_package")
```

see [https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/install.html](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/install.html) for more details.

Once a new package is added, run:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

This will ensure the new package is added to the renv.lock file.

To remove an installed package, run (where "useful_package" is the name of the package to remove):

```R
renve::remove("useful_package")
```

For more on package management with renv, please see [https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

## Deployment

The first time you deploy, go through the Deployment-Setup instructions. Afterwards, you can deploy with one line.

### Deployment Setup (First-Time-Only)

You'll need to set up your credentials for shinyapps.io. You can get your codes from:

- [https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens)

Paste and evaluate your tokens in the RStudio console. They look like this:

```R
# shinyapps.io example credentials
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
  name='shiny-iatlas',
  token='xxx',
  secret='yyy'
)
```

### Deploy with RsConnect

Once your account info is set up, you can deploy with:

```R
rsconnect::deployApp()
```

## Data

Input data for the Shiny-iAtlas portal were accessed from multiple remote sources, including **Synapse**, the **ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud**, and **Google Drive**. For convenience, we have created locally cached versions of dataframe objects as **`feather`** files in the `data2` folder:

- `driver_mutations1.feather`
- `driver_mutations2.feather`
- `driver_mutations3.feather`
- `driver_mutations4.feather`
- `driver_mutations5.feather`
- `driver_results1.feather`
- `driver_results2.feather`
- `feature_values_long.feather`
- `features.feather`
- `groups.feather`
- `immunomodulator_expr.feather`
- `immunomodulators.feather`
- `io_target_expr1.feather`
- `io_target_expr2.feather`
- `io_target_expr3.feather`
- `io_target_expr4.feather`
- `io_targets.feather`
- `til_image_links.feather`

## Methods

While many of the results presented in tables and plots are taken directly from IRWG data (including the main **feature matrix** and various feature and group annotations), we compute some values internally. Unless otherwise noted, the following methods/tools were used to compute summary statistics:

### Correlation — Spearman's rank-order correlation

```R
stats::cor(x, y, method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

### Concordance Index (CI)

Concordance indexes for survival endpoints with respect to different immune readouts were computed using a custom package developed by Tai-Hsien Ou Yang at Columbia University. The **concordanceIndex** package includes a single synonymous function that can be used as follows:

```R
concordanceIndex::concordanceIndex(predictions, observations)
```

... where `predictions` and `observations` are numerical vectors of the same length.

## Troubleshooting

## Startup

To check if 'startup::startup()' ran successfully, type in `DB_HOST` and see if it is set to a non-blank value. For example:

```R
> DB_HOST
[1] "localhost"
```

> Note: You can also check your Global Environment under the "Environment" tab in the upper-right corner of the RStudio session.

The following should all be set: `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_PW` and `DB_USER`. If none of them are set, startup probably didn't succeed. The first thing to check what `.REnviron.d` folder startup is finding. Run:

```R
startup::startup(debug=TRUE)
```

Skip the first half of the output until you see this line:

- `x.xxxs: startup::startup()-specific processing...`

Just below you should see it loading the `./.Renviron.d` and later `./.Rprofile.d`. If yours says anything different than dot-slash-dot-Renviron-dot-d, startup is loading the wrong files.

- If you ran `startup::install` at some point, startup may have created these folders in your user directory. They are probably empty or simply the default values. If so, you can trash them. Then re-run startup with debug=TRUE and see if it works.

- Otherwise, you may need to check your R startup path and see why startup is finding the wrong files. Read more about it here: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/startup/vignettes/startup-intro.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/startup/vignettes/startup-intro.html)

The tail end of your output should look like this:

```bash
0.005s: startup::startup()-specific processing ...

0.010s: Processing 1 Renviron files ...

```

## Database

- If you are initializing the database with `build_iatlas_db` and having a problem where it fails to connect after creating the tables, check that you are not running Postgress locally, outside of docker.
