This module relates to the manuscript:
[Saltz et al. Spatial Organization And Molecular Correlation Of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes Using Deep Learning On Pathology Images; Cell Reports 23, 181-193, April 3 2018.]
(https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30447-9)

TCGA H&E digital pathology images were analyzed for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) using deep learning.
The analysis identifies small spatial regions on the slide image - patches - that are rich in TILs. 
The resulting pattern of TIL patches are then assessed in multiple ways: 
in terms of overall counts and spatial density, and patterns identified by computational analysis and scoring by pathologists."

These assessments are also available in other modules, and are found under the Variable Class: TIL Map Characteristic.
