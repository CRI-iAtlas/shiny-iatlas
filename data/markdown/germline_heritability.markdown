Explore the percentage of variance of immune phenotype traits explained by common genetic variance across different ancestry groups.

Heritability analyses were performed using genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood (GREML) and provide estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the genetic variance, V(Genotype)/Vp. The analyses were conducted separately within each ancestral subgroup, which were derived from ancestry analysis using the genotype data. Each immune trait is assigned to a particular Category and a particular Module, as described in the manuscript.

Select a subset criteria (*Subset by*) and a group of interest (*Show associated results for*) to generate a bar plot summarizing the V(Genotype)/Vp for the immune traits in that group  that have p-values lower than the selected p-value threshold. For a visualization of a single phenotype across different ancestry clusters, select 'Immune Feature' in *Subset by* and the trait of interest in the *Show associated results for* menu. 

For the European ancestry cluster, it is also possible to visualize the percentage of variance of immune traits accounted for by interaction between germline genotypes and immune subtypes (G x Immune Subtype).
