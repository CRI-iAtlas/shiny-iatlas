For each panel, select the desired type of visualization and group of interest. The "Image" option displays an illustration depicting the interaction of  tumor cells and representative innate and adaptive cells in the microenvironment. The "Network" option displays these relationships in a network layout. 

In both visualization options, the resulting figure encodes the estimated abundance of cells, receptors and ligands by different intensities of color. Check the legend for the color ranges of each type.
