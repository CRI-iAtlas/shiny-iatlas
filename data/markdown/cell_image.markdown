For each panel, select the desired type of visualization and group of interest. The "Image" option displays an illustration depicting the interaction of  tumor cells and representative innate and adaptive cells in the microenvironment. The "Network" option displays these relationships in a network layout. 

Abundance estimates are in the range of 0 to 1. In both visualization options, the resulting figure encodes the estimated abundance of cells, receptors and ligands by different intensities of color, where lighter colors correspond to lower values of abundance.  Check the legend for the color ranges of each type.
