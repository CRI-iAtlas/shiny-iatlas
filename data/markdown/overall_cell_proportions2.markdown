Click on the bars for a sample group and you will get generate a scatter plot, showing leukocyte fraction on the Y-axis and stromal fraction on the X-axis. 
Points near the diagonal correspond to tumor samples in which non-tumor stromal cells are nearly all immune cells, and points away from the diagonal correspond to a more mixed or a non-immune stromal tumor microenvironment.
Points in the upper-left triangle of the plot are estimation artifacts.

Manuscript context:  Looking at TCGA tumor types, select PRAD and then SKCM and you will get what corresponds to Figure 2C.
