This allows you to draw barplots for the estimate proportion of different cell types in the immune compartment.
Cellular proportions are estimated using CIBERSORT.
In addition to the original CIBERSORT estimates (22 cell fractions), estimates combining related cell types are provided. 
(In the associated manuscript, these are referred to as Aggregates 1, 2, and 3.)

Manuscript context:  These bargraphs are similar to Figure 2A, and Figure S2A, but with a different arrangement of bars.
