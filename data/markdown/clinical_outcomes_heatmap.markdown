Here, you can explore which variables are associated with improved or
diminished survival within your sample groups. Select a variable class,
and you will get a heatmap, with one row for each variable in that class. 
For a given variable (row) and sample group (column) red denotes decreased 
survival, and blue increased survival as the variable is increased.

Manuscript context:  Selecting variable class "Core Expression Signature",
you can generate Figure 3B. 
Figures 3C, and Figures S3B, S3C, and S3C can also be generated with
different selection options.
