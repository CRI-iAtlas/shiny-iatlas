This module provides short summaries of your selected groups and allows you to see how they overlap with other groups.

You can also upload your own, custom-grouped samples, which will then allow you to compare immune response among those sample groups. 
Following this upload, your custom groupings will be available through Select Sample Groups (left navigation panel), along with the pre-defined groups.

Sample Groups are used in all plots, using the short labels. 
Please refer back to this current module for reminders of those labels.
