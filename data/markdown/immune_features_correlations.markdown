Here, you can look at correlation of a response variable, with other variables, within each sample group. Select, the response variable on the right. Select a variable class on the left to specify which other variable you would like to correlate the response variable with. 
The result will be a heatmap, with positive correlation shown with a red scale, absence of correlation in white, and negative correlation in blue. 
Click on any cell in the heatmap to see the underlying data as a scatterplot.
In the scatterplot, each point represents a tumor sample, the response variable is shown on the Y-axis and the row variable is shown on the X-axis.

Manuscript context:  Select “Leukocyte Fraction” as the response variable, “DNA Alteration” as the variable class, and Spearman correlation.
This will correspond to Figure 4A if you are looking at immune subtypes as your sample grouping.
