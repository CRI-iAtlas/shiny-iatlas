All the modules in the Molecular Response to ICI section of CRI-iAtlas provide visualization of immunogenomics features of the datasets described in the table below.
 
You can also download .csv files by using the buttons at the bottom of the page. The data available to download is organized in the following manner:

- *Datasets metadata*: methods to obtain the data.
- *Immune Features and Clinical Data*: CIBERSORT cell estimates, immune signatures, and clinical annotation.
- *Gene Expression data*: the log2 normalized gene expression data for immunomodulator genes.
 
Details of the methods to compute the features are provided in the Data Description section.
