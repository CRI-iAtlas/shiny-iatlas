**Title:** TCR Inference from Tumor RNA-Seq Data

**Descriptions:** Identification of TCR CDR3 sequences from T cells
  present in the sequenced tumor sections was performed using MiTCR
  v1.0.3,(Bolotin et al., 2013) and previously described parameters to
  optimize extraction from RNA-seq datasets (Brown et al.,
  2015). Briefly, paired-end fastq files were concatenated into a
  single file and run through MiTCR using the appropriate parameter
  set for the sequence read length as described in Brown et al.  Runs
  were performed on the ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud. TCR diversity
  scores (Shannon Entropy, Evenness, and Richness) are provided in
  manuscript Table S1 and in this tool.
