**Title:** The Cell-to-Cell Communication Network

**Descriptions:** A network of documented ligand-receptor, cell-receptor, and cell-ligand pairs (Ramilowski et al., 2015 - https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8866) was retrieved from the FANTOM5 resource at (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/).

CIBERSORT cell types are more granular than the immune cells in FANTOM5 and were therefore summed to yield estimates for FANTOM5 immune cell abundances, as defined above in ‘‘Immune cellular fraction estimates’’ Aggregate 2. For example, FANTOM5 CD19 B cell estimates are the combination of CIBERSORT naive and memory B cells. This network was augmented with additional known interactions of immumodulators, and only ligand-receptor edges that contained at least one cell or one immune modulator were retained, yielding a ‘scaffold’ of possible interactions.

From the scaffold of possible interactions, interactions were identified that could be playing a role within the TME in each subtype or group as follows. Cellular fractions were binned into tertiles (low, medium, high), as were gene expression values for ligands and receptors, yielding ternary values for all ‘nodes’ in the network. The binning was performed over all TCGA samples. In subsequent processing, nodes and edges were treated uniformly in processing, without regard to type (cell,ligand,receptor). From the scaffold, interactions predicted to take place in the TME were identified first by a criterion for the nodes to be included (‘present’ in the network), then by a criterion for inclusion of edges, potential interactions. Nodes selection is based on the abundance threshold. For instance, for an abundance threshold of 66%, the node is entered into the subtype-network if at least 66% of samples within a subtype map to mid or high value bins. An edge present in the scaffold network between any two nodes is then evaluated for inclusion. A contingency table is populated for the ternary values of the two nodes, over all samples in the subtype, and a concordance versus discordance ratio (‘‘concordance score’’) is calculated for the edge in terms of the values of ((high,high)+ (low,low))/(1+(low,high)+(high,low)). Edges are included in the network based on their concordance value. A concordance threshold of 2, for example, selects edges that have both nodes simultaneously highly or lowly expressed (concordant) at least twice as frequent than samples with one node highly expressed and the other lowly expressed (discordant). On the other hand, an edge with a concordance threshold of 0.5 is considered discordant, ie, the frequency of samples with one node highly expressed and the other lowly expressed (discordant) is twice than samples with both nodes simultaneously highly or lowly expressed (concordant).
