**Title:** Confidence Interval for Prognostic Correlation

**Description:** To further dissect the prognostic impact of individual gene expression signatures or immune cell types within immune subtypes and tumor types, we used the concordance index (CI) (Pencina and D'Agostino, 2004) to correlate the immune signatures and the cellular fractions with the outcomes (OS and PFI). The concordance index is defined by the relative frequency of accurate pairwise predictions of survival over all pairs of patients for which such a meaningful determination can be achieved. Samples with missing values in the features of interest or the outcomes were excluded from the analysis. Heatmaps were generated in R using the heatmap.2 function from the gplots package.
