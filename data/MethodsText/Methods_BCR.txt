**Title:** BCR Inference from Tumor RNA-Seq Data

**Description:** We used the VDJer tool (Mose et al., 2016), running
  on the ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud , to reconstruct the immunoglobulin
  heavy chain for all tumor samples. Paired end mRNASeq FASTQ data
  were aligned to human reference genome hg38 using STAR version
  2.4.2a (Dobin et al., 2013). FASTQ files containing more than one
  read length were truncated to the shorter length. STAR was
  configured to emit unmapped reads within the output BAM files and
  samtools was used to generate BAM indices. An estimated insert size
  for each sample was calculated by using bwa version 0.7.12 (Li and
  Durbin, 2009) to align the first 1,000,000 read pairs of each sample
  to a reference human transcriptome and identifying the median bwa
  computed insert length. BCR heavy chain contigs and read alignments
  were generated using V'DJer version 0.12 run in standard mode. RSEM
  version 1.2.21 (Li and Dewey, 2011) was then used to quantify the
  BCR contigs. The RSEM reference was generated by running
  rsem-prepare-reference against the BCR contig fasta file and
  quantification was performed using
  rsem-calculate-expression. Expression counts were normalized to the
  total mRNASeq count for each sample. Isotypes for each contig were
  identified by mapping the trailing 48 bases to the hg38 reference
  and using the resultant alignment coordinates to call the
  isotype. IMGT/HighV-Quest (Lefranc et al., 2009)
  (http://www.imgt.org/IMGTindex/IMGTHighV-QUEST.php) was used to
  identify V and J gene segments, CDR3 sequence and V region identity
  for each contig. IgH diversity scores (Shannon Entropy, Evenness,
  and Richness) are provided in Table S1 of the manuscript and in this
  tool.
