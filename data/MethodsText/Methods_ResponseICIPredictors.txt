**Title:** Predictors of Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor immunotherapy

**Description:** Potential predictors of response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 
  therapy were computed for all samples in the datasets in the Molecular Response to ICI modules.


*Obtaining gene counts:* STAR v2.4.2(Dobin, et al., 2013) was used to align RNA-seq paired fastq reads to the transcript coordinates of hg38. Read mappings to gene isoforms were counted using Salmon v1.1.0(Patro, et al., 2017).  These isoform counts were mapped to genes using biomart(Durinck, et al., 2009) and summed for gene-level counts.


*Diversity calculation:* RNA-seq paired fastq reads were processed using MiXCR v2.1.9(Bolotin, et al., 2015) using the IMGT v201802-5.sv2(Lefranc, 2011) library. Two partial alignments were performed with one extension phase.  Abundance was taken as the sum of reads for each clone. Richness was the total number of clones. Chao1(Chiu, et al., 2014) and Shannon entropy(Shannon, 1948) were calculated using the R Package vegan. Evenness was calculated as Shannon entropy / Log(Richness)(Pielou, 1966). d25, d50 and d75 (dXX) indices were calculated as described by VDJTools(Shugay, et al., 2015) GitHub repository: “The estimate equals to 1 - n / N, where n is the minimum number of clonotypes accounting for at least XX% of the total reads and code N is the total number of clonotypes in the sample.” 

*CIBERSORTx:* CIBERSORTx scores were obtained as described(Newman, et al., 2019).


*IMPRES:* IMPRES scores were calculated as described(Auslander, et al., 2018) and implemented in the Vincent Lab R-package, binfotron::calc_impres (devtools::install_github("Benjamin-Vincent-Lab/binfotron").


*ICP Ratios:* Biocarta or Reactome CTLA4 signature normalized by the Bindea signature (eg CTLA vs Th1: BIOCARTA_CTLA4_PATHWAY signature score / Bindea_Th1_Cells signature score)


*Gene signature derivation:* Gene signatures were derived by running DESeq2(Love, et al., 2014) on gene count data and grouping the significant up and down genes in their respective signatures.


*Gene signature calculations:* Gene counts were upper-quartile normalized and then log2 transformed, log2(normalized counts +1).  Signatures were calculated as the median log2-transformed value of the genes in a given gene signature.
